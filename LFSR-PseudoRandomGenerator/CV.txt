Java-based pseudo-random byte generator using LFSR principles and password seeding.

Combining all three: Developed Java utilities for cryptographic operations, including HMAC authentication, LFSR pseudo-random generation, and SHA-256 file locating.

Other project: Other projects, including cryptographic utilities like HMAC authentication, LFSR pseudo-random generation, and SHA-256 file locating, can be found in my GitHub repo.
