# Cryptographic Challenge Solver

This Java application helps solve a specific cryptographic challenge involving HMACs, MD5 hashing, and AES encryption.

## Features

- Computes HMAC for a given text line and compares it to a target HMAC value.
- Prints the file name of the challenge message based on the computed HMAC.
- Computes the MD5 hash of the solution to the mathematical puzzle.
- Decrypts an AES encrypted message in CTR mode using the MD5 hash.
- Encrypts a response message using AES in ECB mode.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project using your preferred Java IDE.
3. Modify the file paths and other constants as necessary.

## How to Run

1. Compile and run the `Main` class.
2. The program will print the result on the console.

## Dependencies

- Java's built-in cryptographic libraries.
